# Predicting Baseball Player's Salary

#### This project is a University Coursework

- The data of baseball players [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjshepperd/CS5702-Data/master/CS5801_data.rda)
- The project has following subsection:
- - Data quality analysis
- - Data Cleaning
- - Exploratory Data Analysis
- - Building model for players salary (linear regression is used)
- - Predicting if a player will hit/not hit (Logistic regression is used)
- - References

#### Language
- R

#### Package Used
- ggplot2 for data visualization
- dplyr for data manipulation
- stringr for string manipulation
- nanier to see the null value in a nice graph
- validate for data quality checking
- gridExtra for plotting in grid
- tidyr for plotting multiple histogram in single plot
- purr

#### Issues Found
- heteroskadacity
- multicollinarity
